FA_PDB directory contains RNA structures (.pdb files). 
Subdirs:
- Source_PDB: contains the pdb files as downloaded from the PDB Database, taking only the first structure in case of files from NMR
              loop_minimize_FA.sh: 
			for every structure generate topology files for Amber (tleap command)
			performs a minimization using Amber (sander command)
			generates a pdb file from the last configuration of the minimization (ambpdb command)
			copies the minimized file into the FA_minimized directory -> these files are used for all successive work
			computes the Amber energies of the minimized structure (./script_parmed.sh) and move the results in Amber_energies directory
			generates a pdb file using the alternative naming of the atoms (' -> * and others) and copies it into FA4CG directory -> needed for the conversion to coarse-graining

	      loop_minimize_FA.sh has to be used when generating structures from cutting the ones in the DB 
		(need to compute new energy, new CG file, minimization can be commented and skipped)


- Amber_energies : energy files computed for all structures in the DB
- FA4CG : atomistic pdb files (minimized) with the atom names recognized by the generator for the coarse-grained structures
- FA_minimized : atomistic structures minimized with AMBER from native -> this folder has to be used as reference from now on

Prep_pureHire directory contains the generator for CG files
	1. copy an atomistic structure (xyzw.pdb) into the Input directory
        2. generate a directory with all CG files
		 ./generate_run_dir.sh xyzw 
	   -> a dir xyzw is created in Output containing:
		- original atomistic pdb structure xyzw.pdb
		- coarse-grained pdb structure xyzw_CG.pdb
                - parameters.top file for that structure
		- scale_RNA.dat -> external parameter file (parameters to be optimized)  
                - HiRE-test directory containg all files to run the fortrand version of the force-field to check future implementations
			instructions on how to run it are in the SCRIPTS directory
